## Overview

### Origin

Plaid Incorporated is a financial services provider that operates in the domains of digital banking, fraud and compliance, personal finance, risk assessment and credit underwriting, and open finance.

Founded in 2013 by Zach Perret and William Hockey, the company is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Originally aimed at developing financial management products for the end user, Perret and Hockey attempted to bring booking and budgeting software to market. Facing the challenges of linking their software to banking institutions, they shifted their focus to meet this need for a unified banking application programming interface (“API”).

```
“The infrastructure to connect with the bank account between
your consumer fintech products and your bank account, it really
didn’t exist; so we decided to go out and build it” - Zach Perret
```

## Business Activities

When the co-founders began in 2013 there was no good way to connect fintech products and services with consumer personal bank accounts. People were still uploading files, such as CSVs to their financial software, like Quickbooks and Quicken, to populate the ledgers. Funding a brokerage account took weeks of verification. Identities were difficult, if not impossible, to verify in real-time for financial transactions and account links, leaving both financial product providers and consumers at risk of fraud.

Plaid targets a range of customers with its diverse offerings, from business users such as fintech companies, banks, corporate entities, and brokers to individual consumers who experience the technology, sometimes unknowingly, in their financial applications. Plaid has also made a concerted effort to make its tech accessible and developer-friendly, thereby proliferating the market at an accelerated rate.

A sizeable player in the space, one of Plaid’s strengths is the breadth of their current customer base. Plaid has developed a platform that facilitates the connection between Fintech companies, their digital finance offerings, and their user’s accounts with financial institutions. They claim to service over 8,000 fintech providers, facilitating a digital connection to over 12,000 financial institutions. Their technology is used by key fintech companies, including Venmo, Acorns, Betterment, Chime, and SoFi, to name a few. 

According to Stackshare, Plaid is leveraging many technologies to develop its offerings, including Python, Node.js, React, MySQL, MongoDB, Golang, and others. They are using Slack and Salesforce for communications and customer resource management solutions. 


## Landcape

Plaid operates in the fields of personal finance, consumer payments, business finance, lending, open finance, digital banking, and wealth management. Plaid’s technologies power key players in mobile banking, including MoneyLion, Varo, Chime, and M1 Finance.  

Many of the major trends over the past 10 years in this space pertain to the speed and efficiency of financial transactions. The development of blockchain technology has enabled the emergence of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance.

Quovo, one of their primary competitors, was acquired by Plaid for $200 million in 2019.  Some other major players in the space include Stripe, Akoya, Finbox, MX, Envestnet/Yodlee, Finicity, Chime, and N26.

Stripe, with a valuation of $50 billion in 2023, is the largest competitor in the space.  Plaid's latest valuation was in the neighborhood of $13.4 billion, established in its last round of funding in 2021.  Of note, Stripe was valued at $95 billion in 2021.


## Results

Core metrics for success that Plaid highlights in its 2022 Fintech Report and on its website are the overall adoption of fintech products and services by businesses and consumers, growth in market sentiment toward fintech products, regional expansion into UK and Europe, fulfilling compliance requirements and privacy concerns, number of fintech offerings built on Plaid technology, number of team members, and financial solvency.

According to 6sense technographics, in the comparison of technology platforms for specific industries, Plaid ranks number 1 in loan servicing, number 1 in trading, number 1 in mortgages, number 1 in loan origination, number 2 in data quality, and number 14 in application development.

For example, in the loan origination space, Plaid has a market share of 82.42% of all business, with 26 competitors, the top three of which are Ellie Mae, LendingPad, and Byte, according to 6sense technographics (see link in the addendum).

## Recommendations


I would advise the company to continue developing and expanding its fraud and compliance offerings. The primary reason for my recommendation is to continue to rehab from the damage done by the 2022 lawsuit and $58 million settlement reached over customer privacy rights and the collection of superfluous data.  Plaid must continue to protect customer rights and highlight its transparency and ethicality regarding consumer data collection. 

Speaking to the public’s concern about the privacy of personal data, Plaid COO Eric Sager highlights the launch of Plaid Portal, allowing the consumer complete control to grant and revoke permissions for their own data within Plaid’s ecosystem. Proliferating the knowledge of this service is essential. 

In an age of security breaches are ubiquitous and privacy is threatened, Plaid can distinguish itself with KYC (know you customer) validation.

“people’s data leaking [in other software] is so common that we
actually use it as a negative indicator in our anti-fraud models…
if we don’t see you in breach data it means that it is probably a
synthetic or fake identity"

- Alain Meier, Plaid's Head of Identity
```
